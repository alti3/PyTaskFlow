# If your Python package code (the 'pytaskflow' directory) is directly in the project root,
# you might not strictly need the 'packages' key for simple cases.
# However, it's good practice to explicitly tell Hatchling where your package lives.
# If 'pytaskflow' folder is at the root level, this is fine.

# If your source code is in a 'src' directory (e.g., PyTaskFlow/src/pytaskflow/),
# you would configure it like this instead:
# packages = ["src/pytaskflow"]
# sources = ["src"] # This tells Hatch where to find the source root
